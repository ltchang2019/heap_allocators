 * explicit: This program is an implementation of an explicit free list heap allocator. In 
 *           terms of specs, this program uses headers to track block size and allocation 
 *           status (as well as the pointers to next and previous free blocks which are contained 
 *           in the "header" struct). Malloc uses this explicit free list created by the pointers 
 *           to find a new free block (using first fit). Coalescing of immediate right neighbors is 
 *           supported when free is called. Additionally, in-place realloc is supported and attempts 
 *           to merge neighboring right blocks to create enough room in the case of an expansion. 
 *           If the immediate neighboring space isn't large enough, realloc moves the block to another 
 *           part of the heap.
